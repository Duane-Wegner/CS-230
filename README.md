CS-230 Operating Platforms


The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements Summary:

The Gaming Room requested the design of a web-based version of their game, Draw It or Lose It. As a multi-platform game, it allows players to compete by guessing drawings within a time limit. The client required the game to support multiple platforms, including desktops and mobile devices, and to function seamlessly in a distributed environment. Key requirements included scalability for handling increased users, secure user authentication, real-time communication, and high performance across various operating systems.

Strengths in Developing Documentation:

In developing the documentation, I focused on thoroughly analyzing each component of the system architecture and platform compatibility. This allowed me to clearly define design constraints and recommend solutions that aligned well with the client’s requirements, such as choosing Linux for the server-side platform for its scalability and cost-efficiency. Additionally, I effectively used structured sections in the document to make complex technical information clear and accessible.

Helpful Aspects of the Design Document Process:

Working through the design document was particularly helpful in creating a detailed blueprint before coding. It highlighted areas where I needed to pay attention to platform compatibility and performance optimization. Documenting each design decision reinforced my understanding of the client’s needs, which streamlined my coding process, ensuring I implemented features aligned with the intended architecture.

Area for Revision:

If I were to revise one part, it would be the Evaluation section. I would expand this area to incorporate more detailed comparisons of the pros and cons of each operating platform, especially concerning specific gaming requirements. Adding a comparison table with clearer distinctions could enhance the reader’s understanding of each platform’s unique benefits and limitations.

Interpretation and Implementation of User Needs:

I interpreted the client’s need for a seamless multi-platform experience by selecting a cloud-based architecture that supports scalability and real-time communication. I focused on providing solutions like WebSockets for low-latency communication, ensuring a responsive game environment. User authentication and encryption mechanisms were also integrated to address security needs across platforms.

Importance of Considering User Needs:

Considering the user’s needs is essential because it ensures that the software will meet their expectations and provide a satisfying experience. By understanding what players prioritize—like quick response times and security—I could make design choices that aligned with these needs. Neglecting user needs risks creating a product that performs well technically but fails to engage users effectively.

Approach to Software Design:

For this project, I applied modular design principles, breaking down the game’s architecture into manageable components. In future projects, I’d continue using domain modeling to clarify the relationships between classes early on. I also found it useful to draft detailed requirements and constraints upfront, as these served as a foundation for my design. In the future, I would also use prototyping techniques and more user feedback to refine and validate designs during development.
